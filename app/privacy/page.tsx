      <p>
        This site publishes the Veriscopic Evidence Standard (VES) and related
        reference material. It is informational in nature and does not provide
        user accounts, subscriptions, or interactive services.

      <h2>Data Processing</h2>

      <p>
        This site does not collect personal data through forms, user accounts, or
        profiling mechanisms. No registration or login is required to access any
        part of the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        Limited technical information (such as IP address, browser type, and
        request metadata) may be processed transiently by hosting and delivery
        infrastructure for the purposes of security, reliability, and
        performance. This information is not used to identify individuals and is
        not combined with other data sources.
      </p>

      <h2>Consent Demonstration</h2>

      <p>
        Any consent interaction presented on this site exists solely to
        demonstrate evidence-based consent capture in line with the Veriscopic
        Evidence Standard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where consent is exercised, a record is created at the moment judgement
        is exercised, including the applicable context and versioning
        information. This record exists as an evidential artefact rather than as
        a behavioural tracking mechanism, the applicable policy text and context
        are preserved as part of the evidential record and may be inspected via
        the Consent Record page.
      </p>

      <h2>Stewardship</h2>

      <p>
        The Veriscopic Evidence Standard is stewarded by Veriscopic. Questions
        relating to this Privacy Notice or the stewardship of the standard may be
        directed via the Veriscopic website.
