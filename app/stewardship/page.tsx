        The Veriscopic Evidence Standard (VES) is published and stewarded by
        Veriscopic Ltd.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stewardship responsibilities include maintaining the published
        specification, managing versioning, and ensuring continuity and
        accessibility of the standard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stewardship of the standard is distinct from ownership of any specific
        software, platform, or implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        VES is published as an open, referenceable standard intended to support
        independent verification and third-party assessment.
