# Veriscopic Evidence Standard (VES)

Canonical specification site for the Veriscopic Evidence Standard (VES).

This repository contains the published specification and reference pages
for VES, a standard for capturing and verifying evidence of judgement
at the moment it is exercised.

VES is intended to support situations where decisions may be subject
to retrospective scrutiny, including audit, regulatory review,
insurance assessment, legal inquiry, or board-level accountability.

The standard is stewarded by Veriscopic.
